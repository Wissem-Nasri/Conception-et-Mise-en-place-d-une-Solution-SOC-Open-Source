Check Point has published an analysis of the Warzone RAT and its builder. \nThreat Type\nMalware, RAT\nOverview\nIn their blog post on the Warzone RAT, Check Point researchers discuss the sale of the malware, its operation on an infected machine, and the builder/manager used by purchasers of the RAT. The Warzone RAT is advertised on its own website and sold using a subscription model where the most expensive subscriptions provide longer time periods additional features, such as premium DDNS, customer support, and rootkits. The authors also sell cryptors and exploit builders to be used in conjunction with the RAT for an additional cost. As opposed to many similar Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) RATs, which are written in .NET, the Warzone RAT is written in C++ and thus compatible with all Windows releases. The researchers include a deep dive into the UAC bypass methods used by the RAT, which differ depending on whether Windows 10 or an older version is running on the system. After privileges are escalated via the UAC bypass techniques, persistence is established using Registry Run keys. Communication with its C2 is then initiated over TCP port 5200. The payload is RC4-encrypted in most versions of the Warzone RAT. After sending various system information back to the C2 server, such as PC name, RAM and CPU stats, and the OS version, the malware waits to receive commands. Available commands include those associated with remote shell, RDP, or VNC access, task management, file operations, keylogging, and more. If applicable, the obtained data is returned to the C2 server. The researchers also analyzed a sample of the administration panel and builder used by purchasers of the RAT. From this panel, the buyer can easily perform actions against any successful infected hosts.
